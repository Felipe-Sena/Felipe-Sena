Hi, as you can see in my profile I am in fact Felipe Sena.

I'm very interested in computer science, specifically computer graphics and aim to eventually work and publish some project related to the field (FOSS as always), anyways, these are the things that I'm currently working on:

- Blenders (Blender installation and project management): Early in development

And these are the tools I use:

- Visual Studio Code (for now)
- VIM
- Godot
- Blender

And these are the languages I know well:

- C#
- GDScript
- Python
- LaTeX
- JavaScript
- Batch (Windows)
- Lua

And these are the languages I'm working on improving or learning:

- C and C++
- Bash (Linux)
- GLSL and GDShader
- ASM (x86\_64)

And finally: Fuck AI.
