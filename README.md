I have begun migrating to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) for public FOSS projects.

This is due my stance on AI "tools" and how Microsoft is pushing Copilot everywhere they can, even when the use-case is not applicable (which is most of them).

Projects I deem important (Such as Blenders, PathBreaker and TrianglePusher) will be mirrored here, but smaller or personal projects will be on Codeberg.
