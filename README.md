# Migrating
I have begun migrating to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Felipe-Sena) for public FOSS projects.

I'm moving on from GitHub because I don't like AI and how it is being pushed by Microsoft (and all other major companies). I don't feel that using Large Language Models (such as Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, _et al._) and _especially_ image generation models (like StableDiffusion) is worth the resource usage that follows.

I am aware that there are certain use-cases for AI that are ethical and useful, but that's --to my knowledge-- related to medical and academic settings.

With that out of the way, another reason for migrating is that I have largely distanced myself from using Microsoft products willingly, having switched to Linux has really opened my eyes on how badly they handle their stuff, especially the corporate side of Microsoft. There's enough AI and Microsoft whining (with good reason) in this document and in the internet, so the final reason for migrating is simply to try something new :)

# What will happen to this account?
Projects I deem important will be mirrored here, but smaller or personal projects will be on Codeberg.

This account is also going to be used when contributing to other projects that are hosted here on GitHub. Apart from that it's useful to have a GitHub account for things like authorization or work-related things.
